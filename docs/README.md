# Puree

# Description

Puree is a log collector which provides the following features:

- Filtering: Enable to interrupt process before sending log. You can add common params to logs, or the sampling of logs.
- Buffering: Store logs to buffers and send them later.
- Batching: Send multiple logs in a single request.
- Retrying: Retry to send logs after backoff time if sending logs fails.
